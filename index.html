        <p>Hello! My name is Emanuel Carías, I'm 26 years old and I'm a passionate web developer. Originally from Guatemala, I currently reside in the beautiful country of Peru with my amazing wife. Since I was very young, I immersed myself in the fascinating
            world of programming and web creation. I enjoy transforming ideas into interactive and functional experiences. Besides my love for technology, I have a weakness for pizza, nothing beats a delicious well-made pizza! I'm excited to share my
            work and experiences with you through this platform - welcome to my corner of the web! 😎💻🚀🍕</p>
